# Bucket List 

## Overview
This is the front-end for Bucket List, my first independent full-stack project. I also created the [Bucket List Back End](https://github.com/ashratigan/bucket-list-api "Bucket List Back End"). This is a single page application that allows people to sign up and make bucket lists. Users can create, update, delete, and view their bucket lists. I began this project by creating the back end, and then linked this front end to the API that I had created. 

Check out my deployed site: https://ashratigan.github.io/bucket-list-client/

The back end is hosted on Heroku: https://thawing-anchorage-52719.herokuapp.com//sign-up
